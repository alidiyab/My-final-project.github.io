					<h3>Who I Am</h3>
					<p>My name is Ali Diyab, 20 years,I am a front end developer, (with a side of statistics). I live in one of the most beautiful cities of North Iraq, Erbil. I have been using and doing this programing stuff from around one year if memory serves correctly.<br>
						I was born in Qamishli, Syria. I have spent my entire childhood and schooling over there only. As I fall into April, it makes me Aries, mostly calm.

					<h3>My life before Re:Coded program</h3>
					<p>I did my graduation from High schoole, and worked with my father at the electricity company, my job was determined engineering requirements by conducting inspections and analytical tests, Besides that, I was also trying my hands with computer stuff, to got so much interested in it only. Somehow,I have learned Visual Basic language. <br><br>Since the university was started, I left the work and start studying, and I have successed in my first year.<br><br>One day I heard about the Re:coded program, I was very excited to join it, and learn something new in my life. </p>

					<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

					<h3>Why I joined Re:Coded?</h3>
					<p> I love everything is about technology and computer.<br> this program was like a great opportunity to let me develop my skills.<br>I love to learn new things, expanding my horizon of knowledge in every aspect. Life is so short and this world is so big. There is so much out there to learn.</p>

					<h3>My Dreams after Re:Coded</h3>
					<br><br>
					<p>When we talk about the dreams, that is mean we talk about the future.<br><br>
						Future is really something which can’t be defined and bounded in any boundaries. Its certainly can’t be decided too.<br> Yes I have some plans and goals that I have decided for me but its better to keep them a secret for now.<br><br> Lets see where life takes me? Yes whatever I shall be doing, I guarantee you that it will be with full passion and dedication.<br>
						One of my dreams is to be a good developer, a person can create applications for others.<br><br> I will trying to do my best to achieve all my dreams.<br><br>
						My mantra for life is that believe in your self , stay focused and keep going. If you know what you are doing is not wrong than don’t be afraid from doing it ever.Have faith in yourself and on God.Value your relations and people in them.<br> Help those who need you.<br> Give smiles and spread happiness as much you can and it will come back to you in doubles.</p>
